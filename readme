# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi, I'm Mitul Savani, a frontend developer with over 2 years of experience. I'm passionate about creating engaging and intuitive user experiences through clean, efficient code. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or working on my photography skills. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
